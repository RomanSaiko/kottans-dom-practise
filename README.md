### DOM Practice: Action menu 
Implement interactive side-menu' site without page reloads. You may choose any theme: pokemons, phones, site pages aka about/prices/goal/etc.
Main goal - menu with ability to load some predefined html content related to own menu item into right-positioned `<main>` content container.

### Goals

* complex implementation of full page responsive layout (credit to Udacity course about responsive HTML/CSS).
* you can store data in an array of objects
* you can use `innerHTML, insertAdjacentHTML, append, createElement, addEventListener`,
* you may find useful array methods as `Array#filter`, `Array#sort`, `Array#find`, etc.
* and of course - DOM methods.
